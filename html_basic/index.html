    <h1>Welcome to My Portfolio</h1>
    <p>This is my first attempt at creating a basic HTML web page. I’m learning how to structure content properly using HTML tags.</p>

    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>I am currently learning front-end development through the ALX Software Engineering program. It’s exciting to build projects like this one.</p>

    <h3>My Goals</h3>
    <p>My goal is to become a full-stack developer. I enjoy learning new technologies and applying them to solve real-world problems.</p>

    <p>Thank you for visiting my portfolio page. I will keep updating it as I learn more and build new things.</p>
